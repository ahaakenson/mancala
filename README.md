# mancala
Simulates a game of mancala between two programmed players.

User inputs two numbers: one to seed the number generator for the random player and one for the number of rounds in multiplay.
Creates two files: singleplay.txt and multiplay.txt
Singleplay shows the game turn by turn in singleplay.txt

Multiplay plays out the input number of rounds of mancala, and collects statistics on each of the rounds.
The stats are calculated and a summary is printed for each player in multiplay.txt
